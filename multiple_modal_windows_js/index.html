        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>The provided JavaScript code aims to create a card-based interface where each card displays information about
            a particular item. The code is designed to accomplish the following tasks:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Create Cards: The createCard function generates a card element based on the data passed to it. Each card
                contains a title, a short description, and a "Read More" button. Event listeners are attached to each
                card to trigger the opening of a modal when clicked.
            </li>
            <li>Render Cards: The renderCards function populates the cardsContainer with cards created from the data
                obtained from an external source (cardData.js).
            </li>
            <li>Open Modal: The openModal function is responsible for displaying a modal window when a card is clicked.
                The modal contains detailed information about the selected item, including its title, short description,
                and a close button.
            </li>
            <li>Close Modal: The closeModal function removes the modal from view when the close button is clicked or
                when the user clicks outside the modal window.
            </li>
            <li>Event Listeners: Event listeners are attached to the window to handle clicks outside the modal window
                and key presses (specifically the Escape key) to close the modal.
            </li>
            <li>CSS Styling: CSS rules are applied to control the visibility of the "Read More" button on the cards. The
                button is hidden by default but becomes visible when hovering over a card.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Overall, this code provides a functional interface for displaying item information in cards and viewing
            detailed descriptions in a modal window. Additionally, it ensures a smooth user experience by handling modal
            interactions and card hover effects.</p>
